- bug in ReDoc: readOnly objects are still shown in request body schema


- x-status for template/draft/approved/verified
- CRUD test cycle

- links can be refactored


- json pointers could perhaps be used for document references, but arrays are not really sufficient, so the following convention is applied instead:
    The root is referred to as "DESC" - because we will use it to fill in a "description" field
    Nested dictionaries are referenced by keys delimited by "_"
        so, DESC_Info will update the following:
        {
            "Info":{
                "description":"<update here!>"
            }
        }
        nested arrays cannot be traversed currently (this would require reference by index and is not maintainable). However, single arrays can be traversed; they must contain a dictionary with a "name" key. If a "name" key does not exist already, a "x-name" key can be added. The "x-name" key is searched first and is recommended to use in order to ensure a unique reference. Array "name keys" are delimited with "_n-" (where the "n-" is for "Named list item"). 
        so, DESC_foo_n-bar will update the following:
        {
            "foo":[
                {   
                    "description":"blah",
                    "name":"huu"
                },
                {   
                    "description":"<update here!>",
                    "name":"huu",
                    "x-name":"bar"
                },
                {   
                    "description":"blah",
                    "name":"hey"
                }
            ]
        }

        DESC_foo_n-bar_pop will update the following:
        {
            "foo":[
                {   
                    "description":"blah",
                    "name":"huu"
                },
                {   
                    "description":"blah",
                    "name":"huu",
                    "x-name":"bar",
                    "pop":{
                        "description":"<update here!>",
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
